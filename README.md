# üí´ About the project:

This project is an interactive quiz application built to assess users' programming knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. Each quiz session begins by displaying a question along with four answer options. Users have 20 seconds to choose an answer; if time runs out, the correct answer is automatically revealed and no point is awarded.

Upon selecting an option:

If the answer is correct, it is immediately highlighted in green, and the user earns a point.

If the answer is incorrect, the selected option turns red, and the correct one is highlighted in green to provide instant feedback.

In both cases, the options are disabled, and the user must click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to move to the following question.

At the end of the quiz, the application displays a summary showing the total number of correct answers and the user‚Äôs final score.

The app is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience across devices.

This project was created not just to build a functioning quiz, but to deliver a smooth, intuitive, and engaging user experience ‚Äî with real-time feedback, clean design, and a straightforward structure that helps users stay focused and involved throughout the quiz.
